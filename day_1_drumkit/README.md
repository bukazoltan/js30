# drumkit
A learning project: a browser "drumkit" built in vanilla JS. It can be controlled both by mouse clicks and the keyboard.

## Demo
https://bukazoltan.github.io/js30/day_1_drumkit/

## Background
The idea and the sound resources came from the [javascript30 challenge by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/) but I used my own approach to build the project.
